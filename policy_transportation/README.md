# Policy Transportation with Gaussian Process
This code allows to generalize a learned policy with respect to any other possible configuration of object in the scene or point clouds. 
It is a generalization of the concept of task parametrization and it uses gaussian process to learn the transportation map from the original space (source space) to the new space (target space).
